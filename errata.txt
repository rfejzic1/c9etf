C9@ETF project (c) 2015-2018
=========================================


SUPPORTED OS-es

C9ETF was tried on Ubuntu Linux versions 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04. It should work with
other Linux distros as well. We would like to hear about your experience using this 
project with other OS-es. Please contact us at vljubovic AT etf.unsa.ba with details.


PHP-SVN

php-svn package is used in userstats module which converts Subversion logs into a
compressed php-based format that is also used for showing nicely colored change 
logs in admin UI. If you don't care about this feature, the system will work without
it just fine.

As of August 2018, svn package supports PHP versions 4-6, but not PHP 7. See:
https://pecl.php.net/package/svn

If you are using a supported PHP version but your Linux distro doesn't ship a php-svn
package, you can install it using pecl like this:
 $ sudo pecl install svn
(In Ubuntu, pecl is part of php-pear package).

We've found that package version on their Subversion repository works fine with PHP 7. 
Procedure for installing php-svn package from repo:
 $ sudo apt install libsvn-dev php-dev
 $ svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/svn/trunk php-svn
 $ cd php-svn
 $ phpize
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
 
 
NODE.JS VERSION

Cloud9 always requires the latest version of node.js, while Ubuntu repositories 
include a slightly older version. Normally this is not a problem because supported 
version of node.js will be downloaded and installed during Cloud9 installation. 
However, the system node.js is still used during the wizard stage of installation, 
and using the version from Ubuntu repositories may or may not be a problem. Our 
experience so far was that the wizard will throw various errors but everything will 
work in the end.

To be sure, we recommend to download the Current version (not the LTS version!) of
node.js using nodesource repositories:
   https://nodejs.org/en/
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
