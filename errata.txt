=========================================


SUPPORTED OS-es

C9ETF was tried on Ubuntu Linux versions 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04. It should work with
other Linux distros as well. We would like to hear about your experience using this 
project with other OS-es. Please contact us at vljubovic AT etf.unsa.ba with details.


PHP-SVN

php-svn package is used in userstats module which converts Subversion logs into a
compressed php-based format that is also used for showing nicely colored change 
logs in admin UI. If you don't care about this feature, the system will work without
it just fine.

As of August 2018, svn package supports PHP versions 4-6, but not PHP 7. See:
https://pecl.php.net/package/svn

If you are using a supported PHP version but your Linux distro doesn't ship a php-svn
package, you can install it using pecl like this:
 $ sudo pecl install svn
(In Ubuntu, pecl is part of php-pear package).

We've found that package version on their Subversion repository works fine with PHP 7. 
Procedure for installing php-svn package from repo:
 $ sudo apt install libsvn-dev php-dev
 $ svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/svn/trunk php-svn
 $ cd php-svn
 $ phpize
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
