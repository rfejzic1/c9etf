INSTALLING A C9ETF CLUSTER

Each node in a c9etf cluster can have one or more of the following roles:

* CONTROL NODE - public-facing webpage and controller
* STORAGE NODE - storage for user files, also runs background tasks for svn
autocommit and stats generation
* COMPUTE NODE - runs actual c9 servers

In current version of C9ETF there can be exactly one control node and one storage
node, along with multiple compute nodes.

To avoid possible synchronization issues, we recommend that all nodes are as 
similar as possible. They should ideally be cloned from the same image and have
as few of the non-neccessary packages installed as possible. Also, we strongly 
suggest that ntp is installed and configured so that time is accurate, or atleast 
that clocks on all nodes are synchronized


CONFIG.PHP

To setup a cluster you need to edit config.php, specifically the $conf_nodes array
should contain a list of nodes along with their roles. An example of $conf_nodes
is given below:

$conf_nodes = array( 
	array("name" => "c9", "address" => "192.168.1.1", "type" => array( "control", "compute" ) ),
	array("name" => "c9prim", "address" => "192.168.1.2", "type" => array( "compute" ) ),
	array("name" => "c9sec", "address" => "192.168.1.3", "type" => array( "compute" ) ),
	array("name" => "c9nfs", "address" => "192.168.1.4", "type" => array( "storage", "svn" ) ),
);

This declaration is best to be copy-pasted to all nodes in cluster.

In addition, a property named $conf_my_address should be added with IP address of
current node which ofcourse is different for each node. Example of $conf_my_address:

$conf_my_address = "192.168.1.1";


NFS CONFIGURATION

Storage node exports user files to all other nodes using NFS. To achieve optimum
performance we suggest the following /etc/exports given above IP address plan:

/home   192.168.1.1/24(rw,async,nohide,no_root_squash)

This shared NFS folder should be added to /etc/fstab on all other nodes. We suggest
the following line in /etc/fstab:

192.168.1.4:/home      /rhome  nfs     hard    0 0

Note that $conf_home value in config.php should be edited to reflect the location
where NFS path is mounted. On storage node $conf_home should be:

$conf_home = "/home";

But on other nodes you should use e.g.:

$conf_home = "/rhome";


INSTALLATION

After config.php is edited as described, you can follow other steps described in
install.txt. On nodes other then control node you don't need to have nginx and you
don't need to perform steps 4-7, however *don't* do step 7 (logging into web 
interface) until all nodes are installed and configured.
