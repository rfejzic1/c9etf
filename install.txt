=========================================


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Install the following packages on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS:
build-essential
nginx
php-fpm 
php-cli
php-ldap
php-mbstring
inotify-tools
subversion
git
apache2-utils

C9 admin page also uses php-svn package but it no longer supports php7 (see errata).

Optional:
gdb
gdbserver - without this debugging in C/C++ programs will just give an error
astyle - formatting C/C++/Java programs
sqlite3 - for debugging svn problems
valgrind

Make sure that nginx and php-fpm processes are started automatically with OS startup.

We strongly suggest that ntp is installed and configured so that time is accurate,
or atleast that clocks on all nodes are synchronized.


OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

To disable apport and enable core dump detection do the following:

1. Edit /etc/default/apport so that it reads
enabled=0
2. In /etc/sysctl.d create a new file named 60-core-pattern.conf with contents:
kernel.core_pattern = core
3. To apply the changes immediately run:
sudo sysctl --system

To prevent users from reading eachothers files, edit /etc/login.defs, find line
that says:
UMASK		022
and set it to:
UMASK		077

In production environments we suggest to have another look at php configuration,
especially to increase the amount of available memory. Make sure to apply all
changes to nginx configuration in the file nginx.skeleton.conf in
/usr/local/webide.


C9 INSTALLATION

1. Clone c9etf repository in a folder, e.g. /usr/local/webide. 

 $ cd /usr/local
 $ sudo git clone https://github.com/vljubovic/c9etf webide


2. Copy file lib/config.php.default to lib/config.php and edit it to your needs.
Defaults are just fine for test install.


3. Run install.php. This script will make various changes to your system:

 $ cd /usr/local/webide
 $ sudo php install.php


4. Create a local user named 'admin' so you could access the admin web interface:

 $ sudo /usr/local/webide/bin/webidectl add-local-user admin PASSWORD

This user will automatically become a member of "sysadmin" group (see config.php).
Instead of PASSWORD insert the password that you wish to use. Create another local 
user so you can test the webide:

 $ sudo /usr/local/webide/bin/webidectl add-local-user test PASSWORD


5. Visit webpage

http://yourhost/ (login as user "test").

http://yourhost/admin.php (login as user "admin")



UPDATING CLOUD9

To update just Cloud9 from upstream, you can use update-cloud9 script:

 $ sudo php update-cloud9.php
 
This installs Cloud9 into a folder named c9upstream and applies all the patches.
Please look closely if all patches are applied correctly, otherwise system may
not work. If everything looks good, temporarily replace your old install with
new one (make sure all users are logged out otherwise they might complain ;) :

 $ sudo mv /usr/local/webide/c9fork /usr/local/webide/c9old
 $ sudo mv /usr/local/webide/c9upstream /usr/local/webide/c9fork
 
If all works well you can remove old directory to free up some space. Otherwise,
its easy to revert to the old version:

 $ sudo mv /usr/local/webide/c9fork /usr/local/webide/c9upstream
 $ sudo mv /usr/local/webide/c9old /usr/local/webide/c9fork
